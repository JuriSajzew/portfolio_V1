                        Hello, I am a frontend developer based in Stuttgart, Germany. In my
                        previous job as a logistics manager, I often came into contact with programming. I have always
                        been fascinated by the technology and logic behind a user interface. My goal is to develop
                        innovative solutions that exceed the expectations of my customers and at the same time have a
                        positive impact on the users.

                            During my training at Delevolper Academy, I have built several projects. This allowed me to
                            build up my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and TypeScript. Some projects had
                            to be done in a team, which was a lot of fun.

                            I like to explore design trends and experiment with new techniques in my free time. I also
                            work with new technologies to continuously expand my knowledge.
